This file describes the revision history of the FPGA codes (firmware) for the 
CAEN's VME Optical Controller V1718



###############################################################################
Motherboard of V1718/V2718
File name : v1718vub_RevX.Y.rbf   (where X.Y is the revision number)
###############################################################################

NOTE: revisions before 0.4 are not traced since used only for the debug of
the prototypes.


Rev 0.4 (10/05/04)
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
1) Bug fixed in Block Transfer cycles.
NOTE: this version can be used with V1718 only (it doesn't work with the V2718)


Rev 0.5 (28/05/04)
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
1) Address increment on 32 bit (instead of 16) during Block Transfer
   (when the FIFO_MODE is not set).
NOTE: this version can be used with V1718 only (it doesn't work with the V2718)


Rev 0.6 (26/07/04)
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
1) This is the first release of the firmware that can handle the Optical Link of
   the V2718; the same firmware can work with both versions of the Bridge (V1718
   and V2718).
2) The block transfer is optimized in speed.
3) Firmware Upgrade is possible also with the jumper in Backup position (in the 
   previous versions, firmware upgrade was possible only when the jumper was in
   the STD position).
4) The bug which caused wrong data transferred during large size BLT (>480K) 
   cycles was fixed.
5) The register with the interrupt mask for inhibiting the propagation of the 
   interrupts from VME to PCI was added (only for 2718).
6) CONET reset management: the PCI board A2818 can send a RESET command through
   the Optical Link and this resets the data FIFOs and the state machines of the
   VME master.


Rev 0.7 (01/09/04)
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
1) Bug (introduced in rev 0.6) which caused an error during the firmware
   upgrade of the FPGA fixed.


Rev 0.8 (27/09/04)
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
1) Interrupt transfer from VME to PCI implemented at hardware level.
2) Bug fixed: block transfer with large size (>256KB) caused communication error.
3) Bug fixed: access in MBLT64 with blt size = 8 bytes (1 VME cycle) was not 
   executed correctly.
4) Bug fixed: during a BLT16, the crossing of the boundary (256 bytes) was done
   releasing the AS two times (at address 254 and 256, plus multiples).
5) The Sysres of the VME is activated from the push button on the Front Panel
   only when the board is System Controller.


Rev 0.9 (20/10/04)
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
1) Data Transfer from V2718 to A2818 optimized: a 256KB SRAM is used in the A2818
   to store the data coming from the V2718 while the PCI is not yet ready 
   to read them (readout interrupt latency).
   NOTE: this improvement takes effect if you have an A2818 with FW Rev. >= 0.4
2) Bug fixed: BLT read with large size (bigger than 4MB)
3) Response time in the DS/DTACK handshake reduced for BLT cycles.


!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! WARNING !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
The revision 0.9 and older are only compatible with the software release 1.2 
and older.

Rev 0.10 (28/10/04)
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
1) The Bridge to PC data transfer protocol for BLT has been changed in order to
   optimize the packet dispatch in the PC memory.
2) The leading edge of the AS has been delayed respect to the valid address on
   the VME bus; now the delay is about 45 ns.
3) Bug Fixed in V1718 when executing a BLT terminated by a BERR with a BLT size 
   of 64*N-4 for USB 1.1 and 512*N-4 for USB 2.0 (with N = 1,2,3...).
   This bug is not present in the V2718.

Rev 0.11 (02/11/04)
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
1) Changed the data transfer protocol for the internal register read cycle

Rev 0.12 (14/01/05)
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
1) Bug fixed: data loss during MBLT64 (depending on the transfer rate and 
   BLT size).

2) Optimized the slave mode: bigger RAM memory (32x16) and faster readout
   (greater than 60MB/s in MBLT)

Rev 0.13 (22/02/05)
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
1) Bug fixed in the Interrupt Acknowledge in D08.

Rev 0.14 (18/03/05)
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
1) The timing of the IACKOUT signal in the Interrupt Acknowledge cycle has been
   corrected (delayed of about 50ns after the DS0/DS1)


-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------


Rev 1.00 (20/05/05)
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
1) Added support for Multi-Read and Multi-Write operations.

2) Added byte swapping for Big Endian - Little Endian conversion


Rev 2.00 (04/07/05)
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
1) Fixed a bug in the BLT Write cycle. The State Machine that manages the BLT
   cycle has been completely reviewed.

2) Corrected the Byte Swapping (option introduced with the previous Rev 1.00)

3) Assertion of /AS: now the master waits until the slave releases the DTACK 
   before asserting the /AS for a new cycle.

4) The FIFO mode option (that is a BLT cycle without address increment) is now
   set by means of a parameter of the BLT cycle (and not by a bit of the Control 
   Register), allowing different processes to set this option within a single
   atomic command.

Rev 2.01 (21/09/05)
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
1) Added Optical Link LED driving signal for the 9U version (it must work with 
   Rev 0.5 of the A2719CI)

Rev 2.02 (05/12/06)
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
1) Modified the releasing of the AS when a BLT cycle is closed with a BERR by 
   the slave (now the master doesn't wait for the releasing of the BERR before
   releasing the AS).

Rev 2.03 (26/02/07)
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
1) Disabled drivers of the SERCLK and SERDAT lines

Rev 2.04 (21/06/07)
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
1) Added the BLT access executed as a sequence of consecutive single R/W 
   accesses. To enable this mode, it has been added the bit 10 of the 
   VME_CTRL register. 

Rev 2.05 (28/08/07)
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
1) Added a global reset of the V1718 when the USB port is enumerating (this 
   occurs when the USB cable is reconnected or the driver is reloaded).

Rev 2.06 (15/01/08)
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
1) Disabled the drivers of the MTM bus (the MTM bus is connected to the FPGA 
   but for the moment the firmware doesn't provide the access to it)

Rev 2.07 (22/05/08)
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
1) Fixed bug (introduced with the Rev 2.05) in the board reset from the front
   panel: the V1718 occasionally hangs (no USB communication) after a push
   button reset.

Rev 2.08 (24/04/09)
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
1) The "fake BLT" feature introduced with the Rev. 2.04 can be enabled using
   a special opcode (6); it is not necessary (but still possible) to set the 
   relevant bit in the VME_CTRL reg.

Rev 2.09 (18/05/09)
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
1) SYSRES no longer activated after the USB port is enumerated (USB cable 
   reconnected).
   
   Rev 2.10 (12/01/12)
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
1) Fixed bug causing some problems in VME interrupt handling

Rev 2.11 & 2.12 (N.A.)
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Versions not documented

Rev 2.13 (30/08/13)
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
1) Fixed bug causing problems in multi-master access to the VME bus
